# VIAService
<p>This project is for a customer to build a website.
This website needs navigate the content in a single page.
I use <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/"><span>handlerbar</span></a> template engine to meet this requirement.
</p>

## Languages
<p>
The language module is <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/i18n"><span>i18n</span></a> 
To add a language is very flexible, just add a define, and i18n will generate the language file automatically.
